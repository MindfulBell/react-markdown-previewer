React template using webpack/babel to build react applications 



//commands to know:
//npm run dev --> turns on webpack watch for updating changes
//npm run build --> runs webpack in dev mode

//DON'T FORGET TO CREATE A NEW GIT HUB REPO TO PUSH TO OR IT WILL OVERRIDE THE TEMPLATE!!

//git remote add <name> <new github url>
//git remote remove origin
//git remote rename <name> origin

//c9.io: won't allow .babelrc, so have to put it in package.json: 
  //"babel": {
    "presets": ["es2015", "react"]
  //}
